# Additions and Amendments

These rules are open for review and amendment at all times.  A rule or process change requires agreement on the part of 75% of the league (8 owners).

# Non-Rule Related Voting
* A majority vote (7 of 12 for a 2 choice vote, 5 of 12 for a 3 choice vote, etc.) is sufficient to handle general voting, anything not related to rule amendments. For example, voting on whether or not a rule change retroactively applies. 
* When there is a tie and an impasse is reached where all votes are firm, the league must side with no change or no action. If both options require action/change, flip a coin.
* All owner votes count, whether or not they are biased or serve to benefit from a vote or not.
