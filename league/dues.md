# Dues and League Fees

* Dues are **$50 USD** per year.
* First year participants pay up front for **2 years**.
* If an owner wishes to opt out, notice must be given by the end of championship week (NFL Week 16) and the owner’s $50 for the next season will be returned to him/her.  If an owner does not give notice by this time, the $50 will not be refunded.

### Payouts

| Who | Payout |
|:----|:------:|
|League Champion|$300 + League Victor Prize (up to $60 value)<br/>(plus any fines collected)|
|Runner Up|$100|
|Third Place|$60|
|Best Loser|$40|

### League Victor Prize

$10 from every team's dues will go towards a customized piece of apparel for the league champion. The design and procurement will be fascilitated by the League Office of Victory Procurement, headed by a volunteer prior to the start of the season.

### Last Place Fee

To incentivize teams to not “mail it in” at the end of a losing season (especially with the rookie draft’s 1st overall pick on the line), there is a **$20 last place penalty**.  Last place is determined by the team’s record, and then the tiebreakers listed in the [Structure and Schedule](schedule.md) section.
