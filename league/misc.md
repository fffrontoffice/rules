### System Issues

In the event of a system error (e.g. FFFO, Sleeper, the internet in general, etc.) that impacts competition in any way (player acquisition, scoring, etc.), owners may propose options on how to remedy the error in an equitable way following the non-rules voting guidelines. If no option gets majority vote, then the default is to do nothing and let whatever result stay final. All owners must contribute to the remediation by voting on proposed options (or explicitly opting out) within a reasonable time frame given the severity and urgency of the situation. The timeline for closing on the issue in question is subject to the characteristics of the issue, but the guideline would be to close on the issue before the result of the proposed options would impact further competition.
