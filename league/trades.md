## Tradable Commodities

The following resources can be included in trades:

* Active Contracts.
* Practice Squad Contracts.
* Draft picks for the next rookie draft.
* Cap space for the **current season**
  * A team may not have more than $150 of active cap space coming from trades at any time. As trades execute sequentially, even if another trade is going to take place that lowers the team under this limit, the first trade is unable to execute if the team would be over this limit. If it is possible to exercise a multi-team trade (3 or more teams involved) that executes all at once and teams remain under this limit, then those trades are allowed.
* Gum
