# Free Agents

### In-Season Free Agents

During the NFL Regular Season, free agents and waivers can be picked up through a blind bidding process.  Bids are processed every day of the week except Tuesday at 1:00 PM ET.


* An owner may bid for a player even though he has yet to free up salary cap or roster space.  If the owner wins the bid, then he must make room for that player in his cap space within 24 hours and cannot start that player until the team is under the salary cap.
    * After 24 hours goes by over salary cap, the owner will receive a warning.  After 48 hours, fine will be issued.  This fine starts at $5 and increases by an additional $5 for the owner each time it happens.  This money will go toward the championship winnings.
    * If a team starts the player over cap, the player will receive **0 points** for the matchup and the owner will be fined **$20 USD**.  This money will go toward the championship winnings.
* If there is a tie for a winning bid, the player goes to the team with the lower record based on inverse order of standings (resets each week).
* This process is closed after championship week.  (1:00 PM ET Monday, Week 16)
* If a player is dropped, that player cannot be added by the same team until at least one waiver period has passed (see [#37](https://github.com/fffrontoffice/rules/issues/37)).


### Contract Expiration

After championship week all players at the end of their contract are declared free agents.  The first opportunity an owner has to acquire these players will be a Free Agent Auction immediately following the rookie draft.


### Franchise Tag

At the end of the season when player contracts are expiring, a team has the option to apply a “Franchise Tag” on **1 departing player** with the following rules:

* The owner can extend the player’s contract for 1-year at salary of 15% over either their market value or what you paid them last year (whichever is higher).
* The second year a franchise tag is applied to a player, the rate increases to 30%.
* The franchse price has a $50 minimum.
* A player cannot be franchised 3 years in a row.
* A franchise tag must be declared prior to the *pre-draft roster lock*.


### Off-Season Free Agent Auction Draft

After the rookie draft takes place, an auction draft for free agents will be held.

* Players will be nominated for auction by owners in the order of last season’s final standings for at least 2 rounds. At the end of round 2 and each following round, a vote will be taken to determine if the auction needs to continue.
 * Once a player is “won,” the owner must specify the length of contract as soon as possible, but no later than 48 hours of the draft.
* League owners can only bid on and acquire players if there team is under or at their salary cap.  Owners cannot bid more than their cap space will allow.


### Off-Season Free Agent Blind Bidding Auction

After the rookie draft and free agent auction draft, all remaining free agents will be available for blind bidding through the off season.  A bid must go three days (i.e. pass midnight three times) without a better bid being placed before the owner gets the player.  This period ends when rosters are cut down to 26 players 1 week before the start of NFL Week 1.  Teams that are over their salary cap (in the negative) cannot acquire players until they are out of the negative.

When two matching bids are submitted, the bid submitted on an earlier calendar day will take precedence.  If the bids are submitted on the same calendar day, then a tiebreak will be based on the time the bid was submitted.

Owners may bid over their cap or roster size limit, but if a winning bid puts a team over cap space or roster limit, the owner must terminate previously existing contracts until the team once again is within roster and cap limits. New players cannot be added and bids  cannot be won until the team us within roster and cap space limits. Also, a winning bid that puts an owner over cap/roster limits cannot be dropped until the team is within roster and cap limits.
