# Free Agents

### In-Season Free Agents

During the NFL Regular Season, free agents and waivers can be picked up through a blind bidding process.  Bids are processed every day of the week except Tuesday at 1:00 PM ET.


* An owner may bid for a player even though he has yet to free up salary cap or roster space.  If the owner wins the bid, then he must make room for that player in his cap space by releasing or trading players who were on the roster when it was last in a valid state. This must be done within 24 hours and the owner cannot start that player until the team is under the salary cap and within roster size limits.
    * After 24 hours goes by out of compliance, the owner will receive a warning.  After 48 hours, fine will be issued.  This fine starts at $5 and increases by an additional $5 for the owner each time it happens.  This money will go toward the championship winnings.
    * If a team starts the player when the roster is out of compliance, the player will receive **0 points** for the matchup and the owner will be fined **$20 USD**.  This money will go toward the championship winnings.
* If there is a tie for a winning bid, the player goes to the team with the lower record based on inverse order of standings (resets each week).
* This process is closed after championship week.  (1:00 PM ET Monday, Week 16)
* If a player is dropped, that player cannot be added by the same team until at least one waiver period has passed (see [#37](https://github.com/fffrontoffice/rules/issues/37)). To clarify, the owner who dropped the player must take an entire bid cycle off from that player where other owners have a chance to pick up the released player uncontested by the original owner first. If the player is dropped via waiver transaction at the time the typical waiver runs, the next waiver period (typically 24 hours later or Wednesday if drop occurs after waivers on Monday) cannot be used to reacquire the player by the original owner. In the event the player locks and is unable to be acquired until waivers open on Wednesday, the owner who dropped the player must wait until after Wednesday waivers to place a claim. The spirit of this rule is that other owners are able to acquire the player without a competing bid by the owner who released the player.


### Contract Expiration

After championship week all players at the end of their contract are declared free agents.  The first opportunity an owner has to acquire these players will be a Free Agent Auction immediately following the rookie draft.


### Franchise Tag

Before the start of the season, a team has the option to apply a “Franchise Tag” on **1 departing player** (contract expired at the end of previous season). The period to declare a franchise tag begins when Market Values are established 1 week before the free agent auction and ends when rosters are locked prior to the auction. The following rules apply:

* The owner can extend the player’s contract for 1-year at salary of 15% over either their market value or what you paid them last year (whichever is higher).
* The second year a franchise tag is applied to a player, the rate increases to 30%.
* The franchse price has a $50 minimum.
* A player cannot be franchised 3 years in a row.
* A franchise tag must be declared prior to the *pre-draft roster lock*.


### Off-Season Free Agent Auction Draft

After the rookie draft takes place, an auction draft for free agents will be held.

* Players will be nominated for auction by owners from a previously determined list of players known as the **Must Auction Live List** (MALL).
* The MALL contains:
  * Free agents with ESPN average auction amount of $40 or more.
  * Players nominated by owners prior to the start of the draft. Each owner may nominate up to 3 names.
* The Free Agent Auction is over once this list is exhausted. All other free agents become available for acquisition when Offseason Blind Bidding opens. 
* Once a player is “won,” the owner must specify the length of contract as soon as possible, but no later than 48 hours of the draft.
* League owners can only bid on and acquire players if there team is under or at their salary cap and roster size limits.  Owners cannot bid more than their cap space or roster size will allow.


### Off-Season Free Agent Blind Bidding Auction

After the rookie draft and free agent auction draft, all remaining free agents will be available for blind bidding through the off season. A bid must go three days (e.g. pass 7:00 pm PT three times) without a better bid being placed before the owner gets the player except when the bid is submitted less than 3 days before the end of the blind bidding window. Blind bids are processed daily at 7:00 pm PT. 

The blind bidding window ends at 7:00 pm PT on Sunday before NFL Week 1. At this time, all pending bids are processed with the highest active bid winning the player regardless of when it was placed (with ties on the same submitted date going to [blind auction](#off-season-blind-bidding-tie-auction-procedure)). This assumes NFL Week 1 starts with Thursday Night Football and Week 1 waivers processing on Wednesday before the first game. If this timing is not the case, League owners must vote to decide timing.

When two or more matching bids are submitted, the bid submitted on an earlier day (7pm to 7pm) will take precedence. If the bids are submitted on the same processing day and no other pending bids of a higher amount is active, then the owners will engage in a bid-off facilitated by a neutral third party owner and go to the owner willing to pay the most for the player. See [Off Season Blind Bidding Tie Auction Procedure](#off-season-blind-bidding-tie-auction-procedure) for details. 

Teams that are over their salary cap (in the negative) or roster size limits cannot acquire players until their roster is back in compliance. Owners may bid over these limits, but if a winning bid puts a team over a limit, the owner must terminate or trade previously contracts from when the roster was last in a valid state until the team once again is within roster and cap limits. This must be done immediately with the same 24 hours warning and 48 hour fine indicated in "In-Season Free Agents" section above. New players cannot be added and bids cannot be won until the team is within roster and cap space limits. Also, a winning bid that puts an owner over cap/roster limits cannot be dropped or traded until the team is within roster and cap limits.

If a bid loses to a pending bid and the pending bid is cancelled, any bid that lost due to the cancelled bid becomes eligible to win the player based on the established winning criteria from above (i.e. bid must be the highest bid for 3 processing windows). The team winning a player this way has a choice to take the player or not. If the team declines to take the player, their bid is deemed "cancelled" and the bidding process resumes to the next applicable bid based on the criteria above.

When a player is dropped, that player cannot be bid on by the team that dropped him until two bid processing windows (7pm) have passed from the time the player was dropped.

#### Off Season Blind Bidding Tie Auction Procedure

When two or more owners tie for a blind bid, the player on the block and an assigned auctioneer will be announced to all members of the League. The owners competing for the player will be informed of the tie and to send their final offer to their auctioneer where the bid is equal to or greater than the tying bid. The auctioneer will gather bids from all competing parties and declare the winning bid. Each owner has a single opportunity to outbid the other until the tie is broken. Bids must outbid the current highest bid, matching bids after the first bid are not allowed. When owners are equally unwilling to increase their bid beyond a tie, a winning owner will be chosen at random (e.g. coin flip for two owners, another unbiased random selection when more than two owners are competing).

Owners competing for a player in this way must make a best effort to engage with the auctioneer to close on the bidding prior to end of day. Owners must be transparent and communicative about availability windows to ensure the auction goes quickly and fairly.

The auctioneer will be randomly selected from a group of primary League auctioneers (a pool requiring more than 2 volunteers). If all primary auctioneers are competing for the player, then a backup auctioneer will be randomly selected from the remaining non-auctioneer owners in the League. In the event that all owners have tied for the player, all bids are cancelled and the player is available for offseason bidding again.
