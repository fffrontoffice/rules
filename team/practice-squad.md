# Practice Squad

Each team has **4 practice squad slots**.  Rookies are drafted onto the practice squad during the annual rookie draft.  This is a place to park rookie draft picks until you want to activate them (add them to your roster) or drop them.  A player can stay on your practice squad for up to 4 seasons.

### Activating Practice Squad Player

When you activate a practice squad player, you must declare the length of their new contract.  If they are in their first year, you have the option to sign him for 4 years.  The playerâ€™s salary is predetermined based on their draft position (see rookie draft section below).

### Dropping a Practice Squad Player

A practice squad player can be released at any time without penalty regardless of their draft position.

### Rookie Draft

If you have more draft picks than open practice squad spots, you may draft over the amount of spots you have available, but must get your practice squad back to the established maximum before the end of the day after the draft.
