# Team Management

## Salary Cap

1. Each team has an initial salary cap of **$1,000**
2. A team's salary cap can fluctuate due to contract terminations, trades, and by winning challenge bonuses


## Player Contracts

When a player is added to a team, the player signs a contract consisting of a **contract length** and an **annual salary**.

### Contract Length

* Players sign contracts for 1, 2, or 3 years.
* Rookie contracts may be signed for 1, 2, 3, or 4 years.
* At the end of the league’s championship game, the number of years remaining on a contract is decremented.  If the contract has zero years remaining, the player is considered a free agent and will be available to be bid upon at the next free agent auction held after the rookie draft.
* A **contract length must be declared** when the player is acquired.  If a player’s team has a game, whether or not the player plays (including preseason), before their contract length is declared, the player will automatically receive **2 years** and the owner will incur a **$5 USD penalty** to be paid towards the championship pot for the current season.


### Annual Salary

A player’s annual salary is determined based on the following:

1.  Salary at acquisition
2.  Market Value

* **Salary at acquisition:**
    * Initial Draft
        * Auction Rounds: Salary is the amount of the winning bid.
        * Sequential Rounds: No salary.  Player is just happy to be on the squad.
    * Free Agent and Waiver Wire Additions
        * Salary is the amount of the winning bid.
    * Rookie Draft
        * Salary is determined by what pick the player is in the draft.
* **Market Value**
    * **One week before draft day**, the salaries of offensive players with a contract carrying over from the previous year will be evaluated against their average **market value**.
    * If the player is getting paid **less than 50% market value**, the player’s salary will be increased to **60% market value**.
    * The contracts impacted by the valuation will be communicated to league owners **one week before draft day**. Owners will have until the *pre-draft roster lock deadline* (see section Free Agent Auction) to terminate the contract before the increase is applied. The owner will incur the standard contract termination penalty at the pre-valuation contract price.
    * For applicable contracts, the increase to 60% market value will take place at the same time as the *pre-draft roster lock*.
    * Market value adjustments do not apply to defensive players.

*\* __Market Value__ is determined by scaling the average auction values from the FFToolbox average auction value list.*


#### Examples

**Example 1:**

> During the 2009 NFL season, you pick up free agent Miles Austin by blindly bidding $20 against other owners and signing him to a 3 year deal.  Austin’ value continued to rise and now he’s a top WR option.  His market value indicates he is going for $130 in ESPN auction drafts.  Since you are paying him less than $65 (50% his market value), you must now pay him $78 (60% market value, rounded to nearest whole number).

**Example 2:**

> During the 2010 NFL season, you bid $0 (nothing) for Quinton Ganther (RB – SEA).   Since no one else bids on him, you get him for free and sign a 2 year contract with him.  Suddenly, he is the #1 back at Seattle.  Once 2011 rolls around, he has a market value of $50.  He is no longer “free,” you must trade him, pay $30, or drop him incurring the contract termination penalty.


### Terminating a Contract

If you wish to drop a player, thus terminating the contract, you must pay that player **half of his salary for each remaining year** on the contract.  This is taken away from your salary cap for each of those years.

* Termination penalties will round up to the nearest dollar.  So a $7 salary will have a $4 termination penalty.
* There is no termination penalty for contracts with a zero dollar amount.
* After **Week 8** (halfway through the season), the termination penalty is cut in half for the current year.  A player with a $100 salary would have a $50 termination penalty before/during week 8 and $25 termination penalty afterwards.
* Contracts can be terminated at any point in the year except a two day freeze period leading up to the rookie draft and free agent auction.

**Example:**

> You have signed George Georgenson to a 3 year, $10 contract before the 2010 season.  If you decide to drop him in 2010, you lose $5 (10 / 2 = 5) off your total salary cap for this year, 2011, and 2012.  If you dropped him after week 8, you would lose only $3 off the 2010 salary cap, but the full $5 off 2011 and 2012.


### Injured Reserve Salary

Moving a player to your IR slot frees up their salary from the salary cap.  Dropping a play that is on IR still incurs the termination penalty stated above.
