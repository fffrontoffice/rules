# Team Management

## Salary Cap

1. Each team has an initial salary cap of **$1,000**
2. A team's salary cap can fluctuate due to contract terminations, trades, and by winning challenge bonuses


## Player Contracts

When a player is added to a team, the player signs a contract consisting of a **contract length** and an **annual salary**.

### Contract Length

* Players sign contracts for 1, 2, or 3 years.
* Rookie contracts may be signed for 1, 2, 3, or 4 years.
* At the end of the league’s championship game, the number of years remaining on a contract is decremented.  If the contract has zero years remaining, the player is considered a free agent and will be available to be bid upon at the next free agent auction held after the rookie draft.
* A **contract length must be declared** when the player is acquired.  If a player’s team has a game, whether or not the player plays (including preseason), before their contract length is declared, the player will automatically receive **2 years** and the owner will incur a **$5 USD penalty** to be paid towards the championship pot for the current season.


### Annual Salary

A player’s annual salary is determined based on the following:

1.  Salary at acquisition
2.  Market Value

* **Salary at acquisition:**
    * Initial Draft
        * Auction Rounds: Salary is the amount of the winning bid.
        * Sequential Rounds: No salary.  Player is just happy to be on the squad.
    * Free Agent and Waiver Wire Additions
        * Salary is the amount of the winning bid.
    * Rookie Draft
        * Salary is determined by what pick the player is in the draft.
* **Market Value**
    * **One week before draft day**, the salaries of offensive players with a contract carrying over from the previous year will be evaluated against their average **market value**.
    * If the player is getting paid **less than 50% market value**, the player’s salary will be increased to **60% market value**.
    * The contracts impacted by the valuation will be communicated to league owners **one week before draft day**. Owners will have until the *pre-draft roster lock deadline* (see section Free Agent Auction) to terminate the contract before the increase is applied. The owner will incur the standard contract termination penalty at the pre-valuation contract price.
    * For applicable contracts, the increase to 60% market value will take place at the same time as the *pre-draft roster lock*.
    * Market value adjustments do not apply to defensive players.
    * While the League uses FFToolbox, market values less than $50 will be ignored as the volatility and reliability of those prices is too high.

*\* See [Market Value Data Source & Calculation](../league/market-value.md) for M.V. calculation and procedures.*


#### Examples

**Example 1:**

> During the 2009 NFL season, you pick up free agent Miles Austin by blindly bidding $20 against other owners and signing him to a 3 year deal.  Austin’ value continued to rise and now he’s a top WR option.  His market value indicates he is going for $130 in ESPN auction drafts.  Since you are paying him less than $65 (50% his market value), you must now pay him $78 (60% market value, rounded to nearest whole number).

**Example 2:**

> During the 2010 NFL season, you bid $0 (nothing) for Quinton Ganther (RB – SEA).   Since no one else bids on him, you get him for free and sign a 2 year contract with him.  Suddenly, he is the #1 back at Seattle.  Once 2011 rolls around, he has a market value of $50.  He is no longer “free,” you must trade him, pay $30, or drop him incurring the contract termination penalty.


### Terminating a Contract

If you wish to drop a player, thus terminating the contract, you must pay that player **half of his salary for each remaining year** on the contract.  This is taken away from your salary cap for each of those years.

* Termination penalties will round up to the nearest dollar.  So a $7 salary will have a $4 termination penalty and a $1 salary will have a $1 termination penalty.
* There is no termination penalty for contracts with a zero dollar amount.
* Contracts can be terminated at any point in the year except a two day freeze period leading up to the rookie draft and free agent auction.

**Example:**

> You have signed George Georgenson to a 3 year, $10 contract before the 2010 season.  If you decide to drop him in 2010, you lose $5 (10 / 2 = 5) off your total salary cap for this year, 2011, and 2012.  If you dropped him after week 8, you would lose only $3 off the 2010 salary cap, but the full $5 off 2011 and 2012.


### Injured Reserve Salary

Moving a player to your IR slot frees up their salary from the salary cap.  Dropping a play that is on IR still incurs the termination penalty stated above.

### Setting Lineup

Each owner is responsible for making their best effort to set their most competitive lineup to advantage their team for the current season as well as maintaining the competitive integrity of the league. If at any time an owner fails to make their best effort to set their most competitive lineup or at any point makes starting lineup decisions that put into question the competitive integrity of the League, the owner will be fined $20 USD which will be added to the championship winnings. This includes personal hardships where a lineup decision could have been made earlier in the week but does not include personal hardships where a player's injury status is non-definitive prior to aforementioned hardship.

If an owner *intentionally* leaves a starting roster in a position in a non-competitive state (e.g. unfilled, BYE week player, injured player), then the owner must declare intentions to the satisfaction of other League owners. For example, if all of a team's TEs are injured or on a BYE, the owner may choose to leave the spot empty rather than dropping a more valuable player to pick up a low end TE for the week. If any member of the League is unsatisfied with the motivation, a vote may be put forth to determine if (a) the given action is considered "best effort" to set the most competitive lineup to advantage their team for the current season and (b) the competitive integrity of the League is not compromised. If 7 of 11 owners determine the lineup does not meet this criteria, then the owner will pay the fine described above.
